# All-Knowledge as Bite-Sized Lessons

This is a repository for all of my one-page lessons that I'm creating from my All-Knowledge.  I'm seeking to create these lessons into a useful form for others to teach with, and this is the form that's easiest for me to get these lessons out quickly and usefully.

## All-Knowledge?

I've been given a gift from God and Heaven that allows me to bring to everyone a free, equal, and awesome education.  I'm doing my best to bring it to you, and am having trouble reaching people because of people who don't want you to have access to this knowledge.  One way I'm seeking to bring it to you anyway is to write it down and put it online.  It is available wherever you are in the form of a magical school that you can reach by prayer.

## Do I need to believe you?

Nope, I don't ask for anything from you except that if you like the lessons, please pass them on to others.  I'm creating a website that will allow them all to be easily accessed and read, and this repository is so that they don't accidentally get erased by me or some other calamity.

## Asking for a particular lesson

I can write about any topic at all, and it isn't any more effort than writing a page of sentences.  I am using a form of logic to generate and write these articles; they are original works, but I've made it very, very easy to write them and I'm happy to write about whatever subjects you'd like to see.  Please note though, that I won't write to any evil effect at all, and I won't invade anyone's privacy.

## How can I get in contact with you?

You can send me an email at steamdriven80 on gmail.com and I'm happy to talk to you.

## Can you answer questions about God or Heaven?

I sure can, and I'm happy to help you; I like talking about God. :)
